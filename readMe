What is Protractor?

- It is an end-to-end framework for Angular and Angular JS applications.
- Protractor runs test against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would
- It also allows us to test non angular applications using the command browser.ignoreSynchronization = true. We use this function to switch to non-angular pages so that protractor understand that it is not using an angular page
  Why I am using Protractor?
- Identifies web elements with advanced HTML attributes
- Perform cross browser testing (E.G. Chrome, FireFox, Edge ect.)
- Performs End to End Functional Testing

How to setup Protractor in Windows?
Step 1: Download and install node.js

- First, open up a terminal and type in node -v to check if you have node installed, if so it will tell you the version it has
- If not then go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- You will then select windows installer (.msi)
- To Check if you need 32 bits or 64 bits go to File Explorer > This PC> Right Click > Properties > Here it will tell you what your device has
- Go through the Node.JS setup which will also add the path variable, continue clicking next and finally click install
- In terminal, type: node-v to check if its install which shows the version you have
- To check if node.js is installed, we can check in our environment variables, by going to File Explorer > This PC > right click properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > In User variables > Click edit > you will see the path for NPM
- You can also check in system variables clicking edit > and you will see the file path for node.js

  Step 2: Install Protractor

- To check if you have Protractor already, open up a terminal, type protractor –version to see if it exists
- This can only be installed after adding node.js
- Otherwise, to install protractor, open a terminal and type: npm install -g protractor (-g installs globally)
- It should start downloading Protractor to your system
- In terminal type protractor –version to check if its installed
- In terminal you can also type : where protractor
- This gives you the location of the file
- you can check by going to file explorer > This PC > Local disk C > your user > click view tab and tick hidden files > click appData > Roaming > npm > you should see the contents of Protractor

Step 3: Run Command for web driver

- In terminal type: webdriver-manager update
- This downloads browser drivers
- If you go back to npm folder > node_modules > protractor > node_modules > webdriver-manager > selenium > you will see the browser drivers in this folder

  The installation is essentially the same setup on Mac. However, file location will be different.

1. First, you need to open GitHub where I created a repository:
2. Clone the repository in terminal and choose a file location to store the tests
3. In Terminal type: git clone <copy the repo name from the link I sent which was submitted in the test>
4. Open up an IDE such as Visual Studio Code
5. To run the protractor tests, go to conf.js file

6. In This folder, you will see screenshots of each test and also if you click on my-report, it will open up a browser where you can see a summary of the tests and click on where the test has failed
7. In the my-report folder you should see when opening the failed test, you will see in the image that autosuggest is not appearing
